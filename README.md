===========

The primary goal of Gear BPMN is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts who create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus, BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process implementation.BPMN will also advance the capabilities of traditional business process notations by inherently handling B2B business process concepts, such as public and private processes , as well as advanced modeling concepts of entities and processes.
A software system designed to fully automate content management in websites. The goal is to reduce or eliminate the intervention of programmers in editing and managing their sites. The system facilitates the organization, control and publication of documents or other content, such as multimedia images and resources, often facilitates document sharing. Allows translations from the website by adding languages and keys, and also has the ability to translate automatically using external providers. Allows you to create dynamic pages that include creating page blocks and managing them, adding themes, and adapting pages to different environments. It has functional interaction with the database, in the first phase with MSSql and PostGreSql, there is also the management of the entities in the system that are used to store the information in the site, this point is automated and often generated by the system depending on the user's options. The main purpose is to build on a framework a much faster site than if it started from 0. Have an installer that allows the initial setup. It has many working tools with content in many formats, being as close as possible to the user. Possess the cache module for accessing information faster and render in templates, which can also be custom. Possess the notification and messaging module, so the system alerts you about system changes or actions made by other users.
