===========

The primary goal of Gear BPMN is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts who create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus, BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process implementation.BPMN will also advance the capabilities of traditional business process notations by inherently handling B2B business process concepts, such as public and private processes , as well as advanced modeling concepts of entities and processes
