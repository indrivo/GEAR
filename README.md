GEAR | [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/nicolae-lupei/GEAR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/nicolae-lupei/GEAR)   
===========

The1 primary goal of Gear BPMN is to provide a notation that is readily understandable by all business users, from the business analysts who create the initial drafts of the processes, to the technical developers responsible for implementing the technology that will perform those processes, and finally, to the business people who will manage and monitor those processes. Thus, BPMN creates a standardized bridge for the gap between the business process design and process implementation.BPMN will also advance the capabilities of traditional business process notations by inherently handling B2B business process concepts, such as public and private processes , as well as advanced modeling concepts of entities and processes.
A software system designed to fully automate content management in websites. The goal is to reduce or eliminate the intervention of programmers in editing and managing their sites. The system facilitates the organization, control and publication of documents or other content, such as multimedia images and resources, often facilitates document sharing. Allows translations from the website by adding languages and keys, and also has the ability to translate automatically using external providers. Allows you to create dynamic pages that include creating page blocks and managing them, adding themes, and adapting pages to different environments. It has functional interaction with the database, in the first phase with MSSql and PostGreSql, there is also the management of the entities in the system that are used to store the information in the site, this point is automated and often generated by the system depending on the user's options. The main purpose is to build on a framework a much faster site than if it started from 0. Have an installer that allows the initial setup. It has many working tools with content in many formats, being as close as possible to the user. Possess the cache module for accessing information faster and render in templates, which can also be custom. Possess the notification and messaging module, so the system alerts you about system changes or actions made by other users.

# Installation

The app can be started using 3 environments:
- `Development` - is used for development purpose
- `Stage` - is used on pre- production
- `Production` - is used for clients, on server side

`NOTE`: For development use Development env
`NOTE`: Each configuration corresponds to a configuration file, like this: `appsettings.{Env}.json`

### Explanation of appsettings blocks: 
- `SystemConfig` - represent a general section that provide some global info:
    - MachineIdentifier - is used for identify the app id, if is installed multiple GEAR apps, after app installation it is ovverided by generated string
- `ConnectionStrings` - represent databases providers configuration
    - Provider - default is postgres
        - Npgsql.EntityFrameworkCore.PostgreSQL - postgres ,enabled and default
        - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer - enabled
        - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite - for the future
        - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.InMemory - for the future
        - Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Cosmos - for the future
        - Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MySql - for the future
        - Pomelo.EntityFrameworkCore.MyCat - for the future
        - EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServerCompact40 - for the future
        - EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServerCompact35 - for the future
        - EntityFrameworkCore.Jet - for the future
        - MySql.Data.EntityFrameworkCore - for the future
        - FirebirdSql.EntityFrameworkCore.Firebird - for the future
        - EntityFrameworkCore.FirebirdSql - for the future

        - EntityFrameworkCore.OpenEdge - for the future
- [Logging] - see microsoft docs
- `LocalizationConfig` - language configurations
- `IsConfigured` - This property determines whether the app has been installed or not, if set to true then the configurations set in the database are taken, otherwise when accessing any page, it will be redirected to the installer
- `LdapSettings` - This involves configuring the AD mode
- `RedisConnection` - configurations for distributed cache
    - Host - represent the ip address of redis connection
    - Port - represent the port where is bind redis service, default: 6379
- `BackupSettings` - this section is used for backup module, now is developed only for postgres provider
- `EmailSettings` - this section is used for email client
    - Enabled - set active or inactivity of service
    - Host - the smptp host
    - Port - the port of smtp
    - Timeout - represents the time allowed for the service to wait for the message to be successfully sent
    - EnableSsl - represent usage of smtp with ssl
    - NetworkCredential
        - Email - existent smtp email
        - Password - the password of smtp email
- `Sentry` - consult [sentry documentation](https://docs.sentry.io/platforms/dotnet/aspnetcore/) for .net core 

## App run
To start the app, you need:
1. Restore ui packages on all razor projects (is optional step because, they are restored on build)
    ```shell
    libman restore
    ```
2. Restore C# nuget packages by typing 
    ```shell
    dotnet restore
    ```
3. Build. To build, you must navigate the explorer to the path: `./src/GR.WebHosts/GR.Cms` or 
    ```shell
    cd ./src/GR.WebHosts/GR.Cms
    ```
    after it execute the following command: 
    ```shell
    dotnet build
    ```
4. If build has run successfully, it is the green wave to start the project
    ```shell
    dotnet run 
    ```
    `optional` for change exposed port 
    ```shell
    dotnet run --urls=http://localhost:5001/ 
    ```

## Install steps
`Note`: Be sure that in appsettings{Env}.json, the IsConfigured property is set to false
1. Start the application
You will be met by the following message describing the platform
![Welcome board](https://i.ibb.co/5GWdW6N/welcome-gear.png)
Click on `Go to installation`

2. Configure admin profile
![Profile tab](https://i.ibb.co/nQw9kHK/profile-gear.png)
Settings:
- `User Name` - adminstrator user name
- `Email` - your email address to receive emails on system events
- `Password` and `Confirm Password` - the administrator password
- `First Name` - admin first name
- `Last Name` - admin last name
- `Organization Name` - represent the default organization name
3. Set up database provider
![Configuration of database provider](https://i.ibb.co/hMnP7y6/db-gear.png)
`Note`: Use postgres default, because MsSql has not been tested for a long time, we plan support for other providers
`Connection String example`: Host=127.0.0.1;Port=5432;Username=postgres;Password=Gear2020;Persist Security Info=true;Database=Gear.PROD;MaxPoolSize=1000;
4. Press `Install` button and wait until the system is installed
